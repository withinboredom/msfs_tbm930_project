# MSFS TBM 930 Project 0.4.16
This is the improvement project for the MSFS default TBM 930.

I recommend using [GTC 580 Touchscreens-Restyled](https://github.com/StuTozer/G3000-Touchscreens-Restyled/) by [StuTozer](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/u/electrikkar/summary).

And for liveries, see [this post](https://www.nexusmods.com/microsoftflightsimulator/mods/44) on NexusMods.

Current features of this modification are:

* **Removed the 30% gap between 0 and 30% throttle:**

tp_high_idle_throttle_pos = 0; *(default = 30)*

...so then I needed to ajust:

n1_to_shaft_torque_table = ... 68:0.12, 87:0.88 ... *(default = ... 68:0.09, 87:1.0)*

* **Ajusted autopilot maximum pitch:**

max_pitch = 15 *(default = 10)*

* **Corrected some numbers:**

pitch_takeoff_ga = 10 *(default = 8)*

min_n1_for_starter_cutoff = 52 *(default = 50)*

min_n2_for_starter_cutoff = 80 *(default = 200)*

rated_shaft_hp = 850 (default = 0)

CG_aft_limit = 0.355 *(default = 0.36)*

rotation_speed_min = 80 *(default = 90)*

cruise_alt = 31000 *(default = 30000)*

best_glide = 120 *(default = 0)*

* **Ajusted torque vs air density table:**

density_on_torque_table = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.5, 0.000850:0.7, 0.000950:0.745, 0.002378:1.000

(Calculated using POH Maximum Cruise Chart)

*(default = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.6, 0.0008:0.75,  0.0009:0.9,0.000975:1.0, 0.002378:1.000000)*

* **Landing gear creates more drag (by [PositiveZero](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/u/positivezero/summary)):**

drag_coef_gear = 0.04700 *(default = 0.01000)*

* **Decreased inertial separator effect in torque to 7/8 (now 22%, instead of 25%):**

(L:XMLVAR_InertSep#ID#_Deployment) 14336 * (&gt;K:ANTI_ICE_GRADUAL_SET_ENG#ID#) *(default = 16384)*

* **Fuel flow ajusted:**

fuel_flow_scalar = 0.72 *(default = 1.0)*

* **Added [Uwaâ€™s light mod](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020) v1.04**

* **Added [kaosfere's dmimmable G3000 panels](https://github.com/kaosfere/msfs-fixes/tree/master/fixes/tbm930_lighting_fix)**

* **Added [Audible Alert Fixes by Positive Zero](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/tbm-930-audible-alert-fixes-updated/278815)**

## Known Issues:

- ITT is a big problem. Increasing it makes the engine overheat on the ground, and decreasing it makes it stays too low on cruise level. Asobo's cfg is very limited, so I decided not to make any chances on that for now;

- As default, fuel consumption is increasing during climb, which is the opposite that should happen. It's lower than it should be at lower altitudes and higher than it should be at higher altuitudes. That's not happening only on the TBM, and it's a vanilla MSFS issue. The fuel flow will match closely on cruise altitudes, and will be way lower on lower altitudes.
